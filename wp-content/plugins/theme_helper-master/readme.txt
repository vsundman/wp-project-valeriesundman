A developer's inspector to illuminate the WordPress Template Hierarchy and help with building WordPress themes.

== Description ==

A simple,. lightweight plugin that displays useful technical information on pages and posts to aid in developing Wordpress themes. Provides quick access to things that are sometimes hidden, like post/page ID, slug, taxonomy terms, and post type slug. Theme Helper tells you exactly what conditional tags are true on each view, and what template file loaded on each page view. 

* Use In Conjunction with the [WP Template Hierarchy Document](http://wp.tutsplus.com/articles/wordpress-cheat-sheets-template-heirarchy-map/).
* Theme Helper is only visible to logged in Administrators.
* Appears on the right-side of the Toolbar (admin bar). 

== Installation ==

1. Simply unzip and upload to the wp-content/plugins' directory.
